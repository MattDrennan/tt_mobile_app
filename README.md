## Setup

### 1. Firebase project setup

The app uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications. You need to create a Firebase
project and add platform-specific config files before building.

**Create a Firebase project:**

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project
   (or use an existing one).
2. Enable **Cloud Messaging** in the project (Project Settings → Cloud Messaging).
3. Add an **Android app** and an **iOS app** to the project.

**Add the config files:**

| Platform | File | Location in project |
|----------|------|---------------------|
| Android | `google-services.json` | `android/app/google-services.json` |
| iOS | `GoogleService-Info.plist` | `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` |

Download each file from the Firebase Console (Project Settings → Your apps) and place them at the
paths above.

**Regenerate `firebase_options.dart`:**

After placing the config files, regenerate the Dart options file using the FlutterFire CLI:

```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure
```

This updates `lib/firebase_options.dart` with your project's keys. Commit the updated file but
**do not commit** the `google-services.json` or `GoogleService-Info.plist` files — they contain
secret keys.

### 2. Tracker URL (required)

The app loads your Troop Tracker instance in a WebView. Set your URL in `.env`:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (gitignored — never committed):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Edit `.env` and set your Troop Tracker URL:
   ```
   TRACKER_URL=https://your-domain.com/troop-tracker/
   ```

That's it — no build flags needed. The URL must end with a trailing slash.

**Local development:**
Set `TRACKER_URL=http://localhost:8000/` in `.env`.
For a physical device against a local server, use your Mac's LAN IP: `http://192.168.1.x:8000/`
For Android emulator: `http://10.0.2.2:8000/`

**CI / release builds:**
Write a `.env` file from your CI secrets before building:
```bash
echo "TRACKER_URL=$TRACKER_URL_SECRET" > .env
flutter build apk
flutter build ipa
```

### 3. Android signing (release builds only)

Create `android/key.properties`:

```
storeFile=release-key.jks
storePassword=YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD
keyAlias=YOUR_KEY_ALIAS
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
```

## Running the app

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Generating launcher icons

```bash
dart run flutter_launcher_icons
```
